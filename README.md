classification of images from theÂ CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. I preprocess the images and train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.  I also normalized  the images and the labels  to be one-hot encoded. I build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers to get  neural network's predictions on the sample images.
